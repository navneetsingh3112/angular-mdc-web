  <h3 mdcHeadline6>Color Scheme</h3>

  You can define the theme color variables before importing the MDC Web theme:

  <pre><code [highlight]="exampleUsage"></code></pre>

  <h3 mdcHeadline6>Advanced customization</h3>
  <p>Color scheme will only get you 80% of the way to a well-designed app. Inevitably there will be some components
    that do not work "out of the box". To fix problems with accessibility and design, we suggest you use our Sass
    mixins, such as <code>mdc-button-filled-accessible</code>. For more information, consult the documentation for each
    component.</p>
